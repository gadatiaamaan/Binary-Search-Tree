## Binary Search Tree Program

### Overview
Welcome to the Binary Search Tree program! This program allows you to build a balanced binary search tree from a set of integers and find the k-th smallest element in the tree.

### Instructions
To run the program, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Type `make run` into the terminal and press Enter to execute the program.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the array of integers and the value of k.
5. The program will print the binary search tree in the console and output the k-th smallest element.

### Cleaning Up
After running the program, you can clean up any generated files by typing `make clean` into the terminal and pressing Enter.

### Program Files
- `main.cpp`: This file contains the main program code, including functions to build the binary search tree, find the k-th smallest element, and print the binary tree.
- `Makefile`: This file contains commands to compile and run the program.
- `README.md`: This file provides instructions on how to run the program.

### Example Usage
Here's an example of how to run the program:
```
$ make run
