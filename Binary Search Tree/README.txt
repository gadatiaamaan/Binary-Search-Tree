This file will show you exactly how to run and execute my program!

WELCOME TO THIS BINARY SEARCH TREE
This program will have a array of numbers that the user will be able to ask which is the k'th smallest element and the program will run and find the element.

In order to run this program, simple type "make run" into the terminal and the program will execute.
This will then ask for the input and output the k'th smallest element.

After running the program input "make clean" to get rid of the junk files that result from the program.

Have fun!!
